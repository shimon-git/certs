# Cloud Service Types

## **What is the The Available Cloud Service Types?**

Azure Public cloud provide the following cloud service types:

- Infrastructure as a service(IaaS)
- Platform as a service(PaaS)
- Software as a service(SaaS)
---

## **Infrastructure as a service(IaaS)**
The IaaS is consist of the following things:
- Computing
- Storage
- Networking

examples of IaaS:
- Azure Virtual Machine
- Azure Storage
- Virtual Networking
---

## **Platform as a service(PaaS)**
Cloud service providers have an opportunity to provide more than just the "basic" infrastructure.

PaaS includes a service layer on top of IaaS - computing, storage, networking...

With PasS we are freed from worrying about managing the infrastructure, unlike in IaaS.

Middleware, development tools, database server, and more.

examples of PaaS:
- **Azure App service:** simply upload your code and configuration to Azure,
    and it runs your code without needing to worry about the VM underneath.

- **Azure blob storage** provide high scalable, managed storage solution for applications.

- **Azure Database Service** provide high scalable, managed database solution.

- **Application Gateway**

- **Azure Front Door**

- **Load Balancer**

- **Firewall**

## **Software as a service(SaaS)**

Examples for SaaS:
- Cloud apps
- Tools such as Office 356, OneDrive, Skype..

SaaS is ready to be used and simply need to set it up and use it.

## **Serverless**

Some services in Azure have a "Serverless" option.
Serverless is effectively a different pricing model.
Paying for service, not renting hardware.

Examples for serverless:
- Functions
- Container Apps
- Kubernetes(AKS)
- SQL Databases
- Cosmos DB
